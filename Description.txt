 Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that an asset reflects all available information about itself. 
Another way to put the EMH is that it is impossible to predict the future price of an asset without obtaining new 
(publicly unavailable) information. There have been multiple papers that are in favor of this hypothesis. 
However, many people do not believe it, questioning its assumtions. Not believing it, in my opinion, made people 
research more about time series data. As one such non-believer, I would like to use the history of candle stick 
formation of the daily price of a stock to predict whether whether it is a good time for a day-trade. 
Since this is a really new project of mine, I do not have many satisfactory results to show yet though (neither 
in positive nor negative direction). 

 Data: In this project, I scraped historical daily Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume data of the top 250 stocks listed 
in S&P500 from 2015-04-14 to 2020-04-13. 
For a given observation (one day) I create the following variables:
	- last four days' candle stick formations, name them candle1, candle2, candle3, and candle4. 
	- last four days' Volume, name them Volume1, Volume2, Volume3, and Volume4
	- Percentage return of a day trade calculated by assuming that buy price is Open and sell price is Close. 
	- Whether the return from a day trade is profitable, isProfit
