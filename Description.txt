 Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that an asset reflects all available information about itself. 
Another way to put the EMH is that it is impossible to predict the future price of an asset without new obtaining new 
(publicly unavailable) information.There have been multiple papers that are in favor of this hypothesis. 
However, many people do not believe it, questioning its assumtion. Not believing it, in my opinion, made people 
research more about time series data. As one such non-believer, I would like to use the history of candle stick 
formation of the daily price of a stock to predict whether whether it is a good time for a day-trade. 
Since this is a really new project of mine, I do not have many (even preliminery) results to show yet though. 

 Data: In this project, I scraped historical daily Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume data of the top 250 stocks listed 
in S&P500 from 2015-03-31 to 2020-03-31. 
For a given observation (one day) I create the following variables:
	- last four days' candle stick formations, name them candle1, candle2, candle3, and candle4. 
	- The return of a day trade calculated by assuming that buy price is Open price and sell price is Close price. 
	- Whether the return from a day trade is above %1, name it isProfit

 Pre-preliminery Results: For now I have only run a logistic regression to predict the isProfit using the candles for 
my 303,248 data points and obtained an accuracy of %83. However, the precisiona nd recall of my model is very low since 
I have not even optimized my baby model yet. I will add a few more variables to my data and and employ Neural Network 
analysis in the next couple of days.
